# Hands-On Decision-Making

This repository of Colab notebooks was created for the Fall 2024 Hands-On Decision-Making study group at Oregon State University. They cover introductory topics related to reinforcement learning and sequential decision-making. See how RL concepts are implemented and visualize how code modifications affect behavior.

## Topics

### Exploration 1: Markov Decision Processes and Gymnasium Environments

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Intelligent-Reliable-Autonomous-Systems/HandsOnDecisionMaking/blob/main/Exploration1_MazeMDP.ipynb)

This notebook:
- Describes the structure of a Markov Decision Process.
- Implements an MDP for a maze example.
- Gives a playground to interact with the Gymnasium reinforcement learning interface and example environments.
- Creates a Gymnasium wrapper around the maze MDP.
- Visualizes the actions of a random agent and an optimal agent.

Then you can get hands-on tweaking the reward function and transition function.
